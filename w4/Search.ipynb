    "## Big O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, an algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in order to achieve a particular goal. An algorithm is characterized by its running time (run-time), whether in terms of space or time. As data scientists, we are interested in the most efficient algorithm so that we can optimize our workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, Big O notation is used to describe how ‘fast’ an algorithm grows, by comparing the number of operations within the algorithm. This will be explained in further detail later on but for now, let’s understand all of the formal notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Notation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Big Ω: the best-case scenario. The Big Ω of an algorithm describes how quickly an algorithm can run under the best of circumstances.\n",
    "- Big O: the worst-case scenario. Typically, we are most concerned with the Big O time because we are interested in how slowly a given algorithm will run, at worst. How do we essentially make the ‘worst-case’ not as bad as it could be?\n",
    "- Big θ: this can only be used to describe the run-time of an algorithm if the Big Ω and the Big O are the same. That is, the algorithm’s run time is the same in both the best and worst cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are most concerned with the Big O of an algorithm, the rest of this post will only focus on Big O."

    "**How do we use Big O to describe an algorithm? Suppose you wish to search for someone’s name in a phone book. **\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s the most straightforward way of finding this person? Well, you could go through every single name in the phone book until you find your target. This is known as a simple search.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the phone book is very small, with only 10 names, this is a fairly fast process. But what if there are 1,000 names in the phone book?\n",
    "\n",
    "At best, your target’s name is at the front of the list and you only need to need to check the first item. At worst, your target’s name is at the very end of the phone book and you will need to have searched all 1000 names. As the ‘dataset’ (or the phone book) increases in size, the maximum time it takes to run a simple search also linearly increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, our algorithm is a simple search. Big O notation allows us to describe what our worst case is. Our worst case is that we will have to search through all elements (n) in the phone book. We can describe the run-time as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    O(n) where n: number of operations\n",
    "    \n",
    "Because the maximum number of operations is equal to the maximum number of elements in our phone book (you might need to search through them all to find your target’s name), we say the Big O of a simple search is O(n). A simple search will never be slower than O(n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Big O Run Times\n",
    "\n",
    "Different algorithms have different run-times. That is, algorithms grow at different rates. The most common Big O run-times, from fastest to slowest, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- O(log n): aka log time\n",
    "- O(n): aka linear time\n",
    "- O(n log n)\n",
    "- O(n²)\n",
    "- O(n!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Big O cheatsheet is also very useful for a quick graphical representation of the different run times and how they compare to each other."
