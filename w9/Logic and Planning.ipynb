    "# Formal and informal logic\n",
    "Fundamentally, the relationship between informal and formal logic is not clear yet, complete processing of natural language is not solved yet and don’t forget, that requirements in informal logic can easily have errors which can be imperceptible.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s imagine the situation from freelance board:\n",
    "\n",
    "Premise: Bob is a programmer <br>\n",
    "Premise: Programmer develops software <br>\n",
    "Premise: Facebook is software <br>\n",
    "Conclusion: Bob can develop Facebook\n",
    "\n",
    "If you as a freelancer would ask the customer to explain what “Facebook” means, in order to write the implementation mostly correctly, he or she would have to design a formal logic system describing the entity “Facebook”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, such description should look like the greatest attempts of humanity to build logically proved definitions: Euclid’s “Elements” or Spinoza’s “Ethics” where the final definitions (geometry and ethics) are inferred from atomic notions like point, line, circle, god, nature and consciousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, all statements should be proved correctly, be valid, complete and consistent with other known theorems. And even then you can get in trouble, for example, because of Gödel’s incompleteness theorem, which says that even in the formal complete system you can come across with unprovable statements (e.g Liar Paradox).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formal logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The first person who introduced the notion of formal logic (or analytics how it was called those time) and described its basics was a great guy — Aristotle. He discovered 3 of 4 laws of logic (here and further I’ll use C++ logical operators, which every developer is familiar with, instead of math ones):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Law of identity (A == A)\n",
    "- Law of noncontradiction (A && !A == false)\n",
    "- Law of excluded middle (!A || A == true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Does any of this seem familiar?\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly! Boolean algebra, which treats values only as truth values and extends formal logic rules.\n",
    "The fourth rule was discovered by another great logic guy — Leibniz and it’s called “Principle of sufficient reason”. By the way, he was the one to introduce 1 and 0 as true and false. \n",
    "\n",
    "This rule is not formalized so well as Aristotle’s rules but has to be used to make any type of judgments. In other words, we must firstly somehow prove, that our true/false values are really so, to be able to make any conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what can we do in real life with such low-level logic? Basically nothing. We need some rules to build more abstract proposals. \n",
    "And here Propositional calculus comes! This guy allows us to analyze the logical structure of really complicated proposals, which we deal with in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Propositional calculus\n",
    "In daily life our narrative speech consists of utterances — small units of speech, which can be treated as truth value. Let say we have two simple proposals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s cloudy (a)\n",
    "- It’s raining (b)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can say, that it’s raining when it’s cloudy:  <br>\n",
    "a → b\n",
    "\n",
    "This notation means implication. It’s close to if … else statement, apart from being a new proposal it must be a truth value. So in Boolean algebra implication corresponds to a function which takes arguments A and B and returns a truth value. And it returns false only when A is true, but B is false, which means in our context, that it’s cloudy, but not raining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Could it be? Of course!\n",
    "\n",
    "It means that our implication is false and to make it truly we should apply negation:  <br>\n",
    "!(a → b)  <br>\n",
    "or ¬(a → b) in math notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have the complex proposal out of two simple ones, which gives us new information.\n",
    "Besides that, propositional calculus has operators of conjunction, disjunction, exclusive OR and equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the problem of propositional calculus is in its limitation and simplification. It doesn’t know about sets, considering just atomic values. But our brain very actively uses deduction and induction to simplify the surrounding world. And it’s not possible without sets, categories and abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First-order logic\n",
    "First order logic extends propositional logic and besides previously mentioned operators introduces quantifiers. Quantifiers are operators which make possible to operate over sets. There are two of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Universal quantification $∀$ <br>\n",
    "Existential quantification $∃$\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we can apply a quantifier to our weather proposal to get a more detailed result:\n",
    "$$∃ a ∈ A a→b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be read as: there are some clouds a from set of all clouds A, which always cause raining b.<br>\n",
    "And universal quantification could say that all of a belongs to A.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, such kind of statements are already closer to real life, than some atomic values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Higher-order logic\n",
    "And again we are limited because first-order logic can apply quantifiers only to atomic values. But in real life our complex definitions are based on another ones and those are respectively on another ones. Sometimes such a chain can last for a very long time until we get a concept that we cannot really explain. So higher-order logic extends first-order logic making it possible to apply quantifiers not only to atomic values but to sets and predicates as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, what the heck is a predicate?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we considered implication, we discovered, that it’s basically a function, which takes two arguments and returns truth values. So this is exactly what predicate does. It takes any amount of arguments, performs some logic and returns a truth value. Sometimes predicates are also called formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, in order to understand whether our statement is true we have to evaluate the predicate, substituting arguments to our function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependent types\n",
    "In the previous parts we were talking about formal logic and its evolution. We also considered implication, universal quantification and existential quantification. Now it’s time to build a strong bridge between math notions and programming implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But firstly, let’s talk about what actually type is. We use type to restrict data, which comes to our program. For example type Int is a set of numbers from −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Allowing all possible values of this set is called Int type. So any of such values can be encoded with 32 bits and now it’s easy to work with it and be sure about memory safety. But usually our logic notions are much more complicated, so we need a really advanced theory to build basically any kind of restriction over the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "From 1934 to 1969 independently Haskell Curry and William Howard have been observing the correspondence between formals systems and models of computation. Let’s look at the result of this generalization, which was called later as Curry-Howard Correspondence:"

    "\n",
    "One of the most usable types ever. Corresponds to logical AND. Structs in C and Rust, classes in Java, objects in JavaScript, records in Haskell are product types. Basically most of the object orienting programming based on this type. In math notion the following type\n",

    "Looks similar, right? But like the higher level of generalization.\n",
    "### Dependent sum type (Σ type)\n",
    "For П type we saw that it’s related to universal quantification because we can apply any argument to our function. Our type consisted of set of pairs x: F(x). In opposite, Σ type corresponds to only one of such pairs (it’s also called dependent pair). It reflects the meaning of existential quantification: “there is at least one”. There is a certain value and function which type depends on this value. We can union multiple such types (that will be called disjoint union)\n",

    "# Historical intro to AI planning languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Planning or more precisely: automated planning and scheduling is one of the major fields of AI (among the others like: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and more). Planning focuses on realisation of strategies or action sequences executed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intelligent agents** — the autonomous entities (software of hardware) being able to observe the world through different types of sensors and perform actions based on those observations.\n",
    "- **Autonomous robots** — physical intelligent agents which deliver goods (factory robots), keep our house clean (intelligent vacuum cleaners) or discover outer worlds in space missions.\n",
    "- **Unmanned vehicles** — autonomous cars, drones or robotic spacecrafts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish given tasks, these systems need to have input data containing descriptions of initial states of the world, desired goals and actions. And the role of planning systems is to find sequences of actions which lead from initial state to given goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Side note: This sounds simple, but it isn’t — there are different dimensions of problems to consider: deterministic or nondeterministic actions, fully or partially observable state of world, actions concurrency, their durations and time limits and many more. Without proper simplification, each problem can lead to combinatorial explosion — too many combinations of state variables which make the problem unsolvable by agent (state space size grows exponentially with variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent planning problems we use Artificial Intelligence planning languages that describe environment’s conditions which then lead to desired goals by generating chain of actions based on these conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## STRIPS\n",
    "STRIPS is an action language which was a part of the first major planning system with the same name.\n",
    "### Shakey, the robot\n",
    "Originally STRIPS was a name for the planning component in software used in Shakey, the robot developed at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), which was the first machine to be able to reason about its own actions. Shakey with his abilities (visual analysis, route finding, object manipulation and more) is called an ancestor of self driving cars, military drones, Mars rovers and overall field of Robotics and AI. While Shakey’s hardware wasn’t very impressive, its software (architecture and algorithms) was a game changer in world of AI.\n",
    "As a part of this revolution, STRIPS planner gave Shakey the ability to analyse commands (the goals) and break them down into plan of all needed actions (even if Shakey itself wasn’t be able to complete all of them).\n",
    "\n",
    "## STRIPS, classical planning language\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is the most interesting, representational language used by STRIPS planner has much bigger impact on field of AI than its algorithms and is the base for the most of languages used to describe planning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "STRIPS as a classical planning language is composed from states, goals and set of actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **State** is a conjunction of positive literals which cannot contain variables and invoke functions.\n",
    "   - **Goal**, similarly to the state, is conjunction of positive and ground (no variables and no functions) literals.\n",
    "   - **Actions** (also called operators) include preconditions and postconditions. Both represented as a conjunction of function-free literals. Preconditions describe the state of world required to perform action, while postconditions describe state of the world after action is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example from Shakey the robot paper can be helpful with understanding the basics of STRIPS language. It describes task of fetching box from adjacent room.\n",

    "STRIPS language was a good starting point for planning problems representation but there was room for improvements. ADL (Action Description Language) is one of STRIPS extensions which removed some of its constraints to handle more realistic problems. Unlike STRIPS, ADL doesn’t assume that unmentioned literals are false, but rather unknown, what is better known as the Open World Assumption. It also supports negative literals, quantified variables in goals (e.g. ∃x At (P1, x) ∧ At(P2, x)), conditional effects and disjunctions in goals (all not allowed in STRIPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "STRIPS and ADL were inspiration for another extension of representational languages — PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language). It was an attempt to standardise planning languages what made International Planning Competition (IPC) series possible. In other words PDDL contains STRIPS, ADL and much more other representational languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to one common language, the planning competition is able to compare the performance of planning systems using a set of benchmark problems. The most important is that by having one formal standard, we are able to compare systems and approaches but also speed up progress in that field. A common formalism is a compromise between expressive power and the progress of basic research (which encourages development from well-understood foundations).\n"

    "# AI Planning Historical Developments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development 1: STRIPS (1971)\n",
    "In 1971, Richard Fikes and Nils Nilsson at Stanford Research Institute developed a new approach to the application of theorem proving in problem solving. The model attempts to find a sequence of operators in a space of world models to transform the initial world model into a model in which the goal state exists. It attempts to model the world as a set of first-order predicate formulas and is designed to work with models consisting of a large number of formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the STRIPS formulation, we assume that there exists a set of applicable operators which transform the world model into some other world model. The task of the problem solver is to find a sequence of operators which transform the given initial problem into one that satisfies the goal conditions. Operators are the basic elements from which a solution is built. Each operator corresponds to an action routine whose execution causes the agent to take certain actions. In STRIPS, the process of theorem proving and searching are separated through a space of world models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the problem space for STRIPS is defined by the initial world model, the set of available operators and their effects on world models, and the goal statement. The available operators are grouped into families called schemata. Each operator is defined by a description consisting of two main parts: the effects the operator has and conditions under which the operator is applicable. A problem is said to be solved when STRIPS produces a world model that satisfies the goal statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now consider an example of applying the STRIPS language to an Air Cargo transport system using a planning search agent. Suppose we have an initial state of Cargo 1 at SFO, Cargo 2 at JFK, Plane 1 at SFO and Plane 2 at JFK. Now suppose we want to formulate an optimal plan to transport Cargo 1 to JFK and Cargo 2 to SFO.

A plan for this planning instance is a sequence of operators that can execute from the initial state and lead to a goal state. We can use progression search algorithms to form optimal plans for this example problem. Using Breadth-First-Search on this problem, the optimal plan would be Load(C2, P2, JFK), Load(C1, P1, SFO), Fly(P2, JFK, SFO), Unload(C2, P2, SFO), Fly(P1, SFO, JFK), Unload(C1, P1, JFK).\n",

    "## Development 2: Planning Graphs (1997)\n",
    "In 1997, Avrium Blum and Merrick Furst at Carnegie Mellon developed a new approach to planing in STRIPS-like domains. It involved constructing and analyzing a brand new object called a Planning Graph. They developed a routine called GraphPlan which obtains the solution to the planning problem using a Planning Graph construct.\n",
    "The idea is that rather than greedily searching, we first create a Planning Graph object. The Planning Graph is useful because it inherently encodes useful constraints explicitly, thereby reducing the search overhead in the future. Planning Graphs can be constructed in polynomial time and have polynomial size. On the other hand, the state space search is exponential and is much more work to build. Planning graphs are not only based on domain information, but also the goals and initial conditions of the problem and an explicit notion of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Planning Graphs have similar features to dynamic programming problem solvers. The GraphPlan algorithm uses a planning graph to guide its search for a plan. The algorithm guarantees that the shortest plan will be found (similar to BFS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges in a planning graph represent relations between actions and propositions. If a valid plan does exist in the STRIPS formulation, then that plan must exist as a subgraph of the Planning Graph. Another essential feature of planning graphs involve specifying mutually exclusive (mutex) relationships. Two actions are mutex if no valid plan could possibly contain both, and two states are mutex if no valid plan could make both simultaneously true. Exclusion relationships propagate intuitively useful facts about the problem throughout the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GraphPlan algorithm operates on the planning graph as follows: Start with a planning graph that only encodes the initial conditions. In Stage i, GraphPlan take the the planning graph from state i-1 and extends it one time step and then searches the extended planning graph for a valid plan of length i. If it finds a solution, then it halts, otherwise it continues to the next stage. Any plan that the algorithm finds is a legal plan and it will always find a plan if one exists. The algorithm also has a termination guarantee that is not provided by most planners.\n",

    "# Historical development of AI Planning and Search\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Planning & Search in AI\n",
    "AI as a whole is incomplete without the advancement of planning and search. Nowadays many people talk about machine Learning and Deep Learning which is great, but it’s not a complete picture when dealing with a real world problem using AI. Indeed, planning and search is an indispensable subfield of AI. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphplan\n",
    "Graphplan searches for a plan in two stages. The first stage is the construction of a data structure, the plan graph, that efficiently represents information about what the executive could possibly achieve by executing actions from the initial state. The second stage searches backwards from the goals for a substructure within the plan graph that represents a subset of actions that will actually achieve the goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STRIPS\n",
    "The STRIPS system made a very important contribution to Planning research by introducing the Strips Assumption as a way to avoid the complexity of the frame problem for the purposes of planning within the situation calculus. The assumption is that the only changes that arise on application of an action to a situation are those that are explicitly mentioned as positive effects of the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Planning problems are fundamentally dynamic in structure. It is therefore natural to interpret collections of action schemas as defining the transitions in a parameterised automaton and a plan as the transitions traversed by an accepting trace through the instantiated automaton. This view is in contrast with the static view imposed by the situation calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the dynamic and static views have influenced the design of algorithms for planning, although the dynamic view has dominated approaches taken to representation of planning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PDDL\n",
    "The lack of reasoning and expressive power of STRIPS leads to new development of language like PDDL.\n",
    "Planning Domain Description Language was proposed as standards for modelling planning problems based on the STRIPS assumption and support the modelling of a planning problem in terms of a compact representation of the finite state automaton that describes its behaviour. This style of modelling can be extended to support reasoning about continuous as well as logical change, and can provide sufficient expressive power for the modelling of very complex realistic planning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LPG\n",
    "In solving search problem, new development is evolved to treat it as a number of sub-problems that can be searched locally and potentially solve the entire problem as a whole. It also leads to the research of reusability of sub-problem search.\n",
    "\n",
    "LPG replaces the Graphplan search with a far more efficient and more powerful local search technique. This involves identifying an initial candidate plan and refining it by generating alternative possible repairs or modifications to the candidate. Evaluation of alternative refinements is carried out by a heuristic evaluation function. LPG demonstrates that there is significant potential in this technique coupled with techniques capable of exploiting the reachability structure of planning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional and Probabilistic Planning: OBDDs & Markov Decision Process\n",
    "Unlike classical problem planning, most of the real world problem is non-deterministic and not fully observed. For many cases, it needs to evaluate based on observation during execution. It’s not possible to determine the complete actions to reach the goal beforehand. Therefore conditional and probabilistic planning is important. Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) and Markov Decision Process are such algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OBDDs\n",
    "An OBDD-based planner can be easily constructed on the basis of image or preimage computation, and the resulting algorithm is a special case of algorithms for model-checking and construction of counterexamples. The traversal of the state space corresponds to breadth-first search, and there is the choice between forward traversal starting from the initial state and backward traversal starting from the goal states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MDP\n",
    "The Markov Decision Processes model of sequential decision making generalizes many types of AI planning. A main difference between MDP and AI planning is that AI planners do not represent the transition relations associated with state spaces explicitly. There have been works that combine MDPs with the representation of the underlying transition systems as plan operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heuristic search planning\n",
    "Another big exciting trend in development is Heuristic Search Planner. It is able to find a good enough acceptable plan quickly .\n",
    "\n",
    "It works by directing search towards a solution with intelligent exploration of the problem state space. It’s proven to be very effective in guiding search with some kind of control knowledge.\n",
    "The novel contribution made by McDermott and by Geffner and Bonet demonstrated a method by which a surprisingly informative heuristic function could be constructed automatically simply by analysing the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying principle is: The heuristic value of a particular choice of action is based on an estimate of how much work remains to be accomplished following the addition of that action to the plan.To estimate the outstanding work is a very simple: the number of actions required to achieve all the outstanding goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Planning\n",
    "There is suggestion of using Hybrid Planning with combination of specialised problem solver and generic solver in solving complex problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for this is that many hard specialised problems have themselves been the subject of research and good solutions exist for them, while a generic problem-solving technology is very unlikely to challenge these specialised solutions when applied to these problems. It is often the case that these specialised problems appear as subproblems within a larger planning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Development and Issues\n",
    "The complexity of the search problem, and the difficulty of identifying powerful and general search control methods has limited the scope for fielded applications of planning technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central problem is that all decision making process are thrown into the brute-force unexpected search strategy. A planner can quickly becomes unable to cope with the branching factor of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other challenge in the research field is to discover universal algorithms that can show strong performance on a wider range of problems than any of the current algorithms, probably without much of domain expertise.\n",
    "Planners that use distance heuristics almost completely, rely on plain forward or backward chaining, and do not use reachability or other techniques for pruning search trees. These approaches show strengths in different types of problems and has promising future.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few competitions have held that help to drive the research of planning and search. The competitions also put more emphasis on solving practical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example is the Timed Rover domain. It closely models the planetary rover exploratory problems by NASA.\n",
    "Looking into the future, planning has moved from being a puzzle-solving technology to being the foundation of autonomous behaviour.\n"
