    "\n",
    "The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

    "\n",
    "**How a particular problem is solved using recursion?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems, and add one or more base conditions that stop recursion. For example, we compute factorial n if we know factorial of (n-1). Base case for factorial would be n = 0. We return 1 when n = 0.\n",

However, most of the problems that are discussed, can be solved using other known algorithms like Dynamic Programming or Greedy Algorithms in logarithmic, linear, linear-logarithmic time complexity in order of input size, and therefore, outshine the backtracking algorithm in every respect (since backtracking algorithms are generally exponential in both time and space). However, a few problems still remain, that only have backtracking algorithms to solve them until now.\n",

You will first check the first box, if it does not contain the coin, you will have to close it and check the second box and so on until you find the coin.
